# Welcome to BotStar's Public Tracker

This repo is used as a public interface between BotStar users and the team to track bugs and feature requests related to  BotStar - the chat platform. It is available outside of BotStar for use by external public and partner users who need to collaborate with BotStar team.

This repo is not a general purpose issue-tracking tool and is not offered as a consumer product for external teams who want to use it for their own issue tracking. You cannot use this tool as a general place to submit feedback on BotStar products. Please refer to the documentation for individual products for instructions on providing feedback.

# Prerequisites
- Check the BotStar documentation at https://docs.botstar.com
- Check with the community at https://www.facebook.com/groups/botstar/ (faster response in general)

However this public tracker is still a good platform to report bug or highly technical issues that require screenshots or complicated reproduction process.
